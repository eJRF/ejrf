Feature: Grid questions display all

  Background:
    Given I am logged in as a data submitter
    And I have a questionnaire published for my region with sections and subsections
    And I have a grid group with all options of the primary question showable
    And I have 3 questions in that group one of which is primary
    And I have a sub group in that group with two questions
    And I visit that questionnaires section page

  Scenario: Display grid with all options shown
    Then I should see that grid with all the options of the primary question shown

  Scenario: Response to Grid -- Success
    When I respond the questions
    And I click the save button
    Then I should see a message that a draft of my responses has been saved
  I should see my responses filled out

  Scenario: Response to Grid -- Failure
    When I respond wrongly questions
    And I click the save button
    Then I should see a save draft error message
    And the rest of my correct responses
    When I hover the errored cell
    Then I should see the cell error message
