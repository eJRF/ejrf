Feature: Global Admin Assigning Questions

  Background:
    Given I am a logged-in Global Admin
    And I have a questionnaire with sections and with subsections
    And I have assigned questions
    And I have unassigned questions
    When I open that questionnaire for editing

  Scenario: Assign Questions to Questionnaire from within Questionnaire
    When I choose to assign a question to a sub-section
    Then I should see the question bank with both assigned and unassigned questions
    And I should see an option to hide already assigned questions
    When I select the option to hide already assigned questions
    Then I should only see the unassigned questions in the question bank
    And I should not see the assigned questions in the question bank
    When I select questions to assign to the questionnaire
    Then I should see the newly assigned questions in the questionnaire when I am done editing

  Scenario: Unassign Questions from Questionnaire
    Then I should see options for unassigning questions from the questionnaire
    When I choose to unassign a question from the questionnaire
    And I confirm my actions
    Then I should see a message that the question was unassigned
    And that question should no longer appear in the questionnaire
